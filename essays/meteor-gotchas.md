##Searching for a Solution

With learning and understanding how to use Meteor, there are a lot of things that I came to see while using Meteor. One problem with Meteor that I have encountered, I haven't a real solution for it yet, but running Meteor on Windows was slow for me. In order to resolve this problem I tired varirous things to speed up the process of Meteor, such as decreassing the amount of proccess I was using on my laptop as well modifying my visuals on my laptop so that other things could run a lot smoother. And I've also tried setting the process of Meteor running to high priority on my laptop. All of things, I've tried to resolve this problem only helped a bit. The only solution that I found, if you call it one, was either use Meteor on my desktop(high-end) or use a MacBook that I've recently obtained. 

Secondly, another problem that I have encountered while using Meteor was that while building an application Meteor did not start up/run for me and kept getting error messages. I thought that this was a major problem and did not know what to do at first but coming to find out it was an easy solution for me. First I reinstalled Meteor but that did not work at all, so I thought maybe it had to do something with the application I was working on. So I deleted the application that I was working on then I just created a brand new application and copied all my files into that folder. Doing so, Meteor started running normally and launched the application as it should.
