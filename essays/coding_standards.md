## There’s a standard for coding?

Of course that in coding, there are many different languages you could use in certain situations. It’s a given that when you learn a new language, any language whether it is a coding language or the language we speak, that there is certain way the language is laid out and used. Then there’s coding standards, the way I see it, it’s tedious things that may or may not make the code work itself. Although I think that it is tedious, it is a way to keep looking over your code and keeps you thinking. I guess in a way it should become a habit so that it can carry on to other coding languages that you use on the way and maybe in other daily tasks. It’s like a continuous mental exercise and reminder while you are coding. 

## Imeplementing 

Having some experience under my belt with learning and understanding coding standards, I got the chance to code using ESLint with Intellij. This is pretty much spelling and grammar check but with coding. It notifies you when something is wrong with your code with and exclamation point in the top right corner of the window and when everything is fine within your code it gives you green check mark. At first, using ESLint with Intellij, getting the green check mark so that I know my code was good to run it got a little annoying. But now for using it a while now, I got used to it and coding by the standard became almost second nature.
